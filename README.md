## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shwetraj1/ml-predictive-models.git
2. Install dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open each .ipynb file in Jupyter or VS Code and run the cells.

### 💡 Why This Repo Exists
These aren’t tutorial copies — they’re stepping stones in my ML journey. I’m a builder, not a course collector. Every project here taught me how to move from theory to tool — and now they serve as reference points for bigger AI systems like ShadowGPT.
### 🧠 Tech Stack
Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
